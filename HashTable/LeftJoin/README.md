# Left Join
This challenge uses two hash tables to implement a simple Left Join logic.
I assume that the only inputs are the two hash tables with no knowledge of what the key/value pairs are.

## Challenge

Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
